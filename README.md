This is my simple ecommerce project.
The project structure is as follows ; 
       a) project- businessproject
       b) apps - authentication ( This will handle the users registration, login, logout and the profile update section)
               - bizzapp (This is the main app of the project that handles the base.html and the templates of the project)
               - cart ( This will handle the add to cart functionality and the view cart)
               - orders ( Will handle the order history, the check out function and the order confirmation function)
               - products( This will handle the products functionality such as the stock, price, the name )


We have the html templates which include base.html, error.html, cart.html, login.html, profile.html, register.html, order_history.html, checkout.html, confirm_orser.html, productlist.html and categorylist.html
For the database I used Mysql to store my models.
